# Three.js Vanilla JavaScript Project

This is a Three.js project using vanilla JavaScript with Vite as the build tool.

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Source files
  - `main.js` - Entry point and scene setup
  - `style.css` - Global styles
- `index.html` - HTML entry point
- `vite.config.js` - Vite configuration

## Development
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
- Run `npm run build` to build for production
- Run `npm run preview` to preview the production build

## Three.js Guidelines
- Keep scene setup modular
- Use proper disposal for geometries, materials, and textures
- Implement resize handlers for responsive canvas
- Use requestAnimationFrame for animation loops
